  How to use the Metrics API to get the average time your shipments stay in
  picking status before being packed

# Shipments average time in picking

### The problem

You want to get the average time your order shipments remain in the `picking` status before being moved to `packing`, over a selected date and time range.

### The solution

#### Query

You need to perform a [stats query](../queries/stats.md) setting the required query keys as follows and adding the optional ones based on your needs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="367">Key</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><code>field</code></strong></td><td><code>shipments.seconds_in_picking</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>operator</code></strong></td><td><code>avg</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Filter

Make sure to set the desired date and time range using the `date_from` and `date_to` keys in the [filter](../filters.md).&#x20;

As shown in the example below, use `placed_at` as the `date_field` in the [date filter](../filters.md#date-filters) if you want the results to count all the orders that were placed in the selected date and time range ([read more](../filters.md#how-date\_field-works) about this).

### [Try it on Postman](https://www.postman.com/commercelayer/workspace/commerce-layer-public-workspace/documentation/19711194-37a2d863-72f6-4b8f-8146-2f61d405fd3c?entity=request-19711194-cecca701-8d12-4027-aff3-232f222319da) :rocket:

### Example

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
The following request uses the Metrics API to get the average time shipments stay in picking:

<pre class="language-shell"><code class="lang-shell">curl -g -X POST \
  'https://{{your_domain}}.commercelayer.io/metrics/orders/stats' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{your_access_token}}' \
  -d '{
    "stats": {
<strong>      "field": "shipments.seconds_in_picking",
</strong><strong>      "operator": "avg"
</strong>    },
    "filter": {
      "order": {
        "date_from": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "date_to": "2021-12-31T23:59:00Z",
        "date_field": "placed_at"
      }
    }
  }'
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
On success, the API responds with a `200 OK` status code, returning the computed value in the `data` object and additional information in the `meta` object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "value": 123456.78
  },
  "meta": {
    "type": "stats",
    "trace_id": "fe571ea2-8a4f-4a5e-bd26-ac54651bb2e4",
    "mode": "test",
    "organization_id": "xYZkjABcde",
    "market_ids": [ "yzXKjYzaCx", "..." ]
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Similar cases
